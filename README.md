# ivp
A collection of numerical methods for solving Initial Value Problems (IVPs). Work in progress.

# Current features
* Explicit and implicit Euler methods for one-dimensional ODEs.

# Planned features
* Multidimensional ODEs for the above.
* Generic Runge-Kutta methods.
* Finite Element Methods for multidimensional IVPs.
