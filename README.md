# ivp
A collection of numerical methods for solving Initial Value Problems (IVPs). Work in progress.

## Current features
* Explicit and implicit Euler methods for scalar ODEs

## Planned features
* Extend Euler's methods to vector ODEs
* Generic Runge-Kutta methods
* Multi-step methods
* Finite Element Methods for multidimensional PDE IVPs

## Possible future features
* Choices for iteration method used in implicit schemes
